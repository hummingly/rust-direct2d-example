# rust-direct2d-example
This is merely a rewrite/refactor of [gabdube's "D2D1_rs_simple_example"](https://github.com/gabdube/D2D1_rs_simple_example) which works on newer versions of Rust (current version: 1.21). It is based on the MSDN tutorial [Creating a Simple Direct2D Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370994(v=vs.85).aspx).
